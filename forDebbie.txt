*********************************************
Recommended Apps for Debora - (c) 2019 Banky 
---------------------------------------------

First words
------------
Following our whatsapp discussions, I felt it 
might be helpful for you to have a list of all
the apps (with descriptions and a little how 
to use) that I figured you might find useful 
that you can install using the DevSetup script. 

Some are essential (like, how did I live Without
them before now, lol), some I highly recommend, 
and others have specific uses and applications 
that you might find useful in other areas, 
but generally, as you grow you'll come 
to find that most of them come in handy at 
certain points in time, depending on which path 
you decide to take on your programming journey.

NOTE: If you see an app while the script is running
but don't see the app on this list, then 
it's because I feel you don't need it yet or it would
take up too much data (or you probably already have it
installed, like firefox for e.g) so you can ask me 
about it or look it up online if you want to.  

Without Further ado - The List.

The List
-----------

I.   Cmder (Essential):
    An alternative Terminal for windows that also
    has linux/unix commands built in
    How to use: open the command line (as administrator)
    and type 'cmder' and hit the 'enter' key.
    Pro-Tip: you can also place a shortcut in the start
    menu or (what I personally use) have shortcut keys to 
    open it directly/quickly

II.  Velocity (Essential):
    A docset manager that enables you view programming
    documentation offline for several different languages
    How to use: Once installed, start the program (should
    be in the start menu) click the "Add / Download"
    button. Select the languages you wish to download (for
    you I'd recommend HTML, CSS and JS), and click the
    download button to the right of each of them. Once 
    downloaded, you can click the blue arrow at the top left
    of the app window to view the downloaded docsets - Highly
    useful.

III. Code Notes (Essential):
    A code snippets manager. As you learn, you'll most likely
    forget a lot of things, especially solutions you may 
    find in places like stackoverflow or w3schools. So it's
    nice to have a place where you can just store code snippets
    for later use. That's basically what code notes is.
    How to use: The app is pretty straight forward. 

IV.  Git (Essential):
    An open source distributed version control system. 
    Every serious developer uses git. Install it asap,
    and while you're at it, open a github account if you 
    don't have one yet.
    How to use: Ask me, I'll gladly teach you.

V.   Github Desktop (Highly Recommend):
    GUI Desktop Client for Github. 
    How to use: Once installed, run the app, there's a 
    welcome tutorial on there. 

VI.  NodeJS (Essential):
    A Javascript runtime environment built on google chrome's
    V8 engine. It's the present (and future) of programming. 
    How to use: Just install it first. We'll get to this later.

VII. VSCode (Essential):
    Awesome opernsource Text Editor/IDE by Microsoft. You 
    probably already have this installed so you should skip
    How to use: D'uh??? but there's a lot more to it though, 
    like the integrated terminal, intellisense and Emmet and
    1001 extensions. 

VIII.Python (Highly Recommend):
    Even if you don't want to learn python, just install it. 
    It's not that heavy, but it's really handy and a lot of 
    other useful apps will run on it.

IX.  httrack (Highly Recommend):
    For Downloading websites. Some docsets (like MaterializeCSS
    for instance), don't come with velocity, so this is for when
    you need to keep an online reference/resource offline.
    How to use: Just run the app, it's pretty self explanatory

X.   Googler (Highly Recommend):
    For running google search in the command line. Sometimes I 
    might be working in the terminal, and I just want to check
    something quick without opening a browser. Googler is
    perfect for that. Runs on python (told you python would
    come in handy)
    How to use: in the terminal (cmd or cmder), just run the 
    command "googler <whatever you want to google/search for>"
    e.g. googler what is the meaning of life

XI.  Franz (Essential):
    All your communication channels/apps in one place on your computer. 
    How to use: Once installed, run the app, then add services
    you can add whatsapp, facebook messenger, linkedIn, twitter, 
    telegram, slack, even github, among many others. 

XII. Bitnami-Xampp (Essential): 
    You're going to want to get into backend development at
    some point and I feel PHP-MySQL is a good place to start. 

XIII. Notepad++ (If you want to):
    Sometimes I just want to quickly look at some code, or 
    some other text file without opening up VSCode (coz it's
    a bit heavy), so I use this instead. 
    How to use: It's basically Notepad with multiple tabs?

XIV.  VLC Player (Essential): No explanation needed

XV.   Deluge (Highly Recommend): 
    A Cool, simple but very powerful torrent client. No Ads, no 
    BS, just get your torrents. 

XVI. Discord (If you want to):
    It's kind of like a social network, but much cooler. I teach
    webdev and other stuff on there, and many youtubers have 
    discord servers so you'll need it if you want to join their
    servers. 
    How to use: When you install it, let me know, I'll walk you 
    through it.

XVII. Dropbox (Highly Recommend):
    Cloud storage app. Very popular, you might have heard of it
    before, lol. 
    How to use: It's basically google drive without the hassle

XVIII. Youtube-dl (Highly Recommend):
    As you grow, you'll soon come to find that the fastest way 
    to do anything on a computer is through the command line, 
    especially downloading/uploading files. This is for downloading
    youtube videos (and playlists and from other websites as well)
    How to use: in the command line run the following commands
    "youtube-dl <url/link to youtube video>"
    e.g. youtube-dl https://youtu.be/-3igNThTdqM 
    or to view help files run youtube-dl --help 

XIX. Filezilla (Highly Recommend):
    for basic FTP and SFTP (File transfer Protocol and SSH
    File Transfer Protocol). Basically for uploading and downloading
    files to and from your hosting easily and quickly.

XX.  MailSpring (If you want to):
    For managing multiple email boxes in one place. personally
    I have like, what, 9 email addresses? (but I'm not a yahoo
    boy I swear, like, for real, lol). I just like to have 
    seperate mail boxes for different purposes. 

XXI. Screenpresso (Highly Recommend):
    For taking screenshots and screen video recordings. 

XXII. Slack (Highly Recommend):
    It's honestly not the best communication app, but most 
    companies and tech groups use it (Andela, Lambda schools etc)
    so just install it for their sakes, lol.

XXIII. Ramme (If you want to):
    Basically Instagram on your desktop. 
    I used to do social media marketing quite a while ago and it
    was such a pain uploading stuff coz I had to copy it to my phone
    first then etc blah blah. Ramme helps solve that problem.


Final words
------------

Hope the above list, the devSetup.bat script and the apps 
themselves prove useful to you Deborah.
Can't wait to see you go above and beyond on your 
programming journey.
