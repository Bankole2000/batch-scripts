## What is This?

A small collection of batch scripts I wrote for personal use. Built with [DOS Batch](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Choco](https://chocolatey.org/), and a bit of [Patience](https://simpleprogrammer.com/improve-your-patience-developer/)...

## Main Features:

- **devSetup.bat** - Batch file to quickly setup and install several `Choco` and `NPM` software packages (*designed for Public Use*).
- **backup.bat** - Batch file to quickly backup files from different locations in the windows file structure (*for private use*).
- **browse.bat** - Batch file to quickly open local and internet urls in chrome (*for private Use, requires chrome*).
- **go.bat** - Batch file to quickly open local and internet urls in chrome (*for private Use, requires chrome*).
- **push.bat** - Batch file to quickly push to remote repository (*designed for Public Use, requires github account*).
- **RemoveDrive.exe** - Executable file to eject USB drives from the Command Line. (*designed for Public Use).
> Note: Batch Files designated "*for private use*" can easily be adapted for your own personal use as well, just require a little costumization. Working on the docs for that. Updates will be in this readme.
